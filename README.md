[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/trailheadapps/northern-trail-outfitters)

Northern Trail Outfitters is a fictional outdoor clothing company. It helps with creation and management of merchandise mixes with retailers. A merchandise mix is a collection of products a retailer carries for a season. These merchandise mixes are then submitted to the manufacturing division of the company to let them know how many of each product to produce.

## Code Highlights

### Caching data with storable actions

Storable actions make it easy to implement client-side data caching, which is one of the most impactful things you can do to improve the performance of your Lightning components. Check out the FundTileList component. A storable action is used to retrieve funds from the server and cache the response at the client-side. Read [this blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2017/03/lightning-components-best-practices-caching-data-storable-actions.html) for more information.

### Caching data with a custom cache

In addition to storable actions, you can also build your own custom cache solution. For example, for data that never (or rarely) changes, you can build a custom cache that retrieves the data from the server once, caches the response, and never goes back to the server. Check out the [DataCache](force-app/main/default/staticresources/DataCache.js) static resource for an example. And then check out the SectorSelector and AssetClassSelector components to see how itâ€™s used to cache the list of sectors and asset classes. Read the [Modularizing Code in Lightning Components blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2016/12/lightning-components-code-sharing.html) for more details, and for different strategies to implement a custom cache.

### Using Base Lightning Components

Custom user interfaces are built by leveraging Base Lightning Components, like [lightning:path](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_lightning_path.htm) and [Lightning Data Service](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/aura_compref_force_recordData.htm). This simplifies the development experience as validations, CSS-styling and and data handling are automatically handled by the platform. See the Lightning component [MixPath](force-app/main/default/aura/MixPath) for details on that.

### Third-party JavaScript libraries and standard HTML5 interactions

The [MerchandiseMix](force-app/main/default/aura/MerchandiseMix) component shows how a third-party library like [countUp.js](https://github.com/inorganik/countUp.js/) can be used within Lightning Experience. The same component also contains an example how to use standard HTML5 functionality like [drag&drop](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp) within a Lightning component.
